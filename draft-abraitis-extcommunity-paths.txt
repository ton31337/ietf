1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new BGP Opaque Extended Community to carry
   the number of paths available for an arbitrary prefix.  BGP speakers
   that receive this extended community can configure local instance to
   influence their decision process by preferring routes with a higher
   number of paths over others.

   [RFC7911] defines a BGP extension to send multiple paths for the same
   address prefix without the new paths implicitly replacing any
   previous ones.  However, if the ADD-PATH capability is not possible
   to use between BGP speakers, Available Paths Count Extended Community
   can be another way to prefer a prefix which has more paths.

2.  Available Paths Count Extended Community

   This is an Transitive Opaque Extended Community [RFC4360] with the
   following encoding:

           0                   1                   2                   3
           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          |       0x03    |      TBD      |             Reserved          |
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          |                    Reserved                   |     Count     |
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   1.  The value of the high-order octet of the extended Type field is
       0x03, which indicates it is transitive.

   2.  The value of the low-order octet of the extended Type field as
       assigned by IANA is TBD.

   3.  Reserved field MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon the receipt of
       this community.

   4.  The last octet of the extended community is an unsigned integer
       that gives the count of the available paths for an arbitrary
       prefix.

3.  Deployment Considerations

   If the BGP speaker supports the extension defined in this document,
   it SHOULD attach the Available Paths Count Extended Community to BGP
   UPDATE messages sent to iBGP peers implicitly.

   The receiving BGP speaker, SHOULD derive a count of available paths
   from the last octet of the extended community if present.

   An implementation SHOULD NOT send more than one instance of the
   Available Paths Count extended community.

   By default, an implementation SHOULD NOT send this extended community
   to eBGP peers.  However, it SHOULD be possible to configure an
   implementation to send or accept the community when configured.

   The implementation SHOULD provide a way to explicitly disable sending
   this community.

   Also, the implementation COULD provide a way to involve Available
   Paths Count Extended Community into best path selection process.  The
   prefix with the higher count of paths SHOULD win.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests IANA assign a number from the Transitive Opaque
   Extended Community Sub-Types registry for "Available Paths Count"
   extended community.  Registration procedures come under the First
   Come First Served.
