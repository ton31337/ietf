      <t>In modern data center designs, we tend to have conventional hosts participating in the routing process.
      And the fleet of hosts has different versions of routing daemon.
      This means that troubleshooting is a crucial part to quickly identify the root cause.

    <section title="Operation">
    <t>The Version capability SHOULD only be used for displaying the version of a speaker in order to make troubleshooting easier.
    You have a bunch of routers with a number of upstreams each. All of them are with a different operating system and routing daemon installed.
    Assuming that a specific feature is not working or a bug which is not fixed in an appropriate version,
    would allow us to quickly identify the pattern which versions are affected.
    Below is an example of how it looks like with version advertised by a BGP sender:</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
