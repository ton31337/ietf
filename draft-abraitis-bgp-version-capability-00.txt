                       Version Capability for BGP
                draft-abraitis-bgp-version-capability-05

Abstract

   In this document, we introduce a new BGP capability that allows the
   advertisement of a BGP speaker's routing daemon version.

   This BGP capability is an optional advertisement.  Implementations
   are not required to advertise the version nor to process received
   advertisements.

1.  Introduction

   In modern data center designs, we tend to have conventional routers
   participating in the routing process.  And the fleet of routers has
   different versions of routing daemon.  This means that knowing which
   versions of the routing daemons are running the various routers in
   the network can be a crucial factor in quickly identifying the root
   cause of any protocol or network problems.

   This BGP capability is an optional advertisement.  Implementations
   are not required to advertise the version nor to process received
   advertisements.

   Information about the version of the routing daemon could also be
   exchanged in protocols such as LLDP and CDP.  However, in
   containerized environments, it is very hard and not recommended to
   exchange this information between background processes.  Therefore,
   and to help minimize operational costs, it is helpful to exchange the
   routing daemon information between BGP peers directly.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Version Capability

   Capabilities avdertisements with BGP are defined in [RFC5492].  They
   utilise the BGP Capabilities Optional Parameter that contains one or
   more triples <Capability Code, Capability Length, Capability Value>.
   This document defines a new BGP capability, the Version Capability,
   with Capability Code TBD and Capability Length and Capability Value
   as described below.

   The inclusion of the Version Capability is OPTIONAL.  If an
   implementation supports inclusion of the capability, the
   implementation MUST include a configuration switch to enable or
   disable its use, and that switch MUST be off by default.

   The Version Capability is intended principally more to non-production
   environments where more visibility is needed for troubleshooting
   purposes.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED for use outside single Autonomous
   System domain or Autonomous System Confederations, except you have a
   topology with a number of routers each with a separate Autonomous
   Number.

   An implementation that does not recognize or support the Version
   Capability but which receives one MUST respond as described in
   [RFC5492] by ignoring the option.  An implementation that wishes to
   complain that its neighbor does not support the Version Capability
   MAY use the 'Unsupported Capability' Error Subcode of a Notification
   message as described in [RFC5492].

   The triple for the Version Capability is as follows:

   Capability Code

      TBD by IANA

   Capability Length

      The Capability Length for the Version Capability MUST be greater
      than zero.  A value of zero SHALL be treated as an encoding error
      and the entire triple MUST be ignored.

      The Capability Length SHOULD be no greater than 64.  This is the
      limit to allow other capabilities as much space as they require.

   Capability Value

      The Capability Value field is encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  It is
      unstructured data and can be formatted in any way that the
      implementor decides.

4.  Operation

   The Version capability MUST only be used for displaying the version
   of a speaker to make troubleshooting easier.  You have a bunch of
   routers with a number of upstreams each.  All of them are with a
   different operating system and routing daemon installed.  Assuming
   that a specific feature is not working or a bug which is not fixed in
   an appropriate version, would allow us to quickly identify the
   pattern which versions are affected.

   Enabling this capability REQUIRED bouncing all existing BGP sessions.
   It MUST be explicitly configured to advertise the Version capability.

   Below is an example of implementation in [FRRouting] how it looks
   like with version advertised by a BGP sender:

:~# vtysh -c 'show ip bgp summary failed'
...
Neighbor      EstdCnt DropCnt ResetTime Reason
198.51.100.2        3       3  00:00:35 Waiting for peer OPEN (n/a)
198.51.100.3        3       3  00:01:12 Peer closed the session (FRRouting 7.2-b3ac21114g)
198.51.100.4        3       3  00:00:14 Peer closed the session (FRRouting 7.3-g4c566878f)
198.51.100.5        3       3  00:00:45 Peer closed the session (FRRouting 7.4-a25sg503g2)
...

   > | jq '."198.51.100.1".neighborCapabilities.versions'
   {
     "advertisedVersion": "FRRouting 7.2-dev-MyOwnFRRVersion",
     "receivedVersion": "FRRouting 7.2-dev-MyOwnFRRVersion-gc68bb14"
   }

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters"
   registry with a subregistry called "Capabilities Codes".  IANA is
   requested to assign a capability number from the First Come First
   Served range for the Version Capability in this document as follows:

   +-------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | Value |   Description   |                Reference                |
   +-------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------+
   |  TBD  |     Version     | [draft-abraitis-bgp-version-capability] |
   |       |    Capability   |                                         |
   +-------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------+

                        Table 1: Version Capability

6.  Security Considerations

   The Version Capability can be treated as sensitive information, thus
   it would be easier for an attacker to exploit by knowing the specific
   version of the BGP speaker.  This information can be gathered in BGP
   OPEN messages.

   The Version Capability MUST be configurable with a vendor-specific
   knob to be able to enable or disable the capability.  The vendor
   might implement to disable this capability per neighbor.

   It would be safe to enable this for iBGP or inside the same tenant
   where you have full control and the BGP speaker is behind exit
   points.

   The Version Capability information can be gathered in BGP OPEN
   messages.

   Modifying the information advertised by a router might lead to
   attacks including bogus software upgrades and also might mask the
   causes of faults in the network.

   Advertising which versions of code and from which vendor it comes may
   facilitate a number of social-engineering attacks.  A lot of BGP
   implementations leave TCP/179 open and this could lead to sensitive
   information disclosure.  This capability is NOT RECOMMENDED for eBGP
   use.

   Sensitive information leaks can be minimized by using the [RFC5082]
   mechanism or firewalls to filter out TCP 179 port from untrusted
   networks.  This capability can be disabled per neighbor, thus the
   sensitive information can't be disclosed to untrusted neighbors.
