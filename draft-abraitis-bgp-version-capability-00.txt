1.  Introduction

   In this document, we introduce a new BGP OPEN Optional Parameter Type
   that allows the advertisement of a BGP speaker's routing daemon
   version.

   In modern data center designs, we tend to have conventional routers
   participating in the routing process.  And the fleet of routers has
   different versions of routing daemon.  This means that knowing which
   versions of the routing daemons are running the various routers in
   the network can be a crucial factor in quickly identifying the root
   cause of any protocol or network problems.

   This new Optional Parameter Type is an optional advertisement.
   Implementations are not required to advertise the version nor to
   process received advertisements.

   Information about the version of the routing daemon could also be
   exchanged in protocols such as LLDP and CDP.  However, in
   containerized environments, it is very hard and not recommended to
   exchange this information between background processes.  Therefore,
   and to help minimize operational costs, it is helpful to exchange the
   routing daemon information between BGP peers directly.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft     Software Version Optional Parameter      January 2023


3.  Software Version BGP OPEN Optional Parameter Type

   The Optional Parameters in the BGP OPEN message are defined in the
   base BGP specification [RFC4271].  This document defines a new BGP
   OPEN Optional Parameter Type, the Software Version, with Type TBD and
   value is up to 255 octets.  The value field is encoded in UTF-8
   [RFC3629].  It is unstructured data and can be formatted in any way
   that the implementor decides.

   The inclusion of the Software Version Optional Parameters is
   OPTIONAL.  If an implementation supports the inclusion of this
   parameter, the implementation MUST include a configuration switch to
   enable or disable its use, and that switch MUST be off by default.

   The Software Version BGP OPEN Optional Parameter is intended for
   environments where more visibility is needed for troubleshooting
   purposes.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED for use outside a single Autonomous
   System, or a set of Autonomous Systems under a common administration.

   An implementation that does not recognize or support the Software
   Version Optional Parameter but receives one must ignore it.

   The value of this Optional Parameter consists of one identifier,
   which identifies the software and its significant version.  Software
   version identifier consists of a product and optional product
   version.

   identifier = product ["/" product-version]

   A sender SHOULD limit generated product identifiers to what is
   necessary to identify the product; a sender MUST NOT generate
   advertising or other nonessential information within the product
   identifier.  A sender SHOULD NOT generate information in product-
   version that is not a version identifier (i.e., successive versions
   of the same product name ought to differ only in the product-version
   portion of the product identifier).

   Example:

   frrouting/8.4.2, ios/12.5.1, junos/12.1

4.  Operation

   The Software Version BGP OPEN Optional Parameter SHOULD only be used
   for displaying the version of a BGP speaker's router daemon to make
   troubleshooting easier.

Internet-Draft     Software Version Optional Parameter      January 2023


   Consider a group of routers each with a number of upstream nodes, and
   suppose that each router has a different operating system and
   different routing daemon at a different version installed.  Assuming
   that a specific feature is not working or that there is a bug which
   has not been fixed in a particular version of the code, knowledge of
   the routing daemon versions would allow an operator to quickly
   identify the pattern of which versions are affected.

   Enabling (i.e., turning on) this parameter requires bouncing all
   existing BGP sessions and the feature MUST be explicitly configured
   before an implementation advertizes the Software Version Optional
   Parameter.

4.1.  Example Usage

   Below is an example from the [FRRouting] implementation showing both
   the received and advertised Software Version:

   :~# vtysh -c 'show ip bgp summary failed'
   ...
   Neighbor EstdCnt DropCnt ResetTime Reason
   ens192         3       3  00:00:35 Waiting for peer OPEN (n/a)
   ens224         3       3  00:01:12 Waiting for NHT (frrouting/7.2)
   eth0           3       3  00:00:14 Neighbor deleted (frrouting/8.4.2)
   ...

6.  IANA Considerations

   The BGP OPEN Optional Parameter Types registry is a standalone
   registry.  IANA is requested to assign a capability number from the
   First Come First Served range for the Software Version BGP OPEN
   Optional Parameter in this document as follows:

                 +=======+==================+============+
                 | Value |   Description    | Reference  |
                 +=======+==================+============+
                 |  TBD  | Software Version | [This.I-D] |
                 +-------+------------------+------------+

                             Optional Parameter

7.  Security Considerations

   The Software Version BGP OPEN Optional Parameter should be treated as
   sensitive information: it could be easier for an attacker to exploit
   the system if they know the specific software version and
   manufacturer of a BGP speaker.  This information could be gathered by
   inspecting BGP OPEN messages that carry the Software Version BGP OPEN
   Optional Parameter defined in this document.  Furthermore, this
   knowledge may facilitate a number of social-engineering attacks.

   Modifying the information advertised by a router might lead to
   attacks including bogus software upgrades and also might mask the
   causes of faults in the network.

   Users of this mechanism should be aware that unless a transport that
   provides integrity is used for the BGP session in question, the
   Software Version parameter can be forged.  Unless a transport that
   provides confidentiality is used, the Software Version parameter
   could be snooped by an attacker.  These issues are common to any BGP
   message but may be of greater interest in the context of this
   extension as explained above.  Refer to the related considerations in
   [RFC4271] and [RFC4272].

   Users of this mechanism should consider applying data minimization
   practices as outlined in Section 6.1 of [RFC6973], as appropriate
   within the deployment context.

   Sensitive information leaks can be minimized by using the [RFC5082]
   mechanism or firewalls to filter out TCP 179 port from untrusted
   networks.  This optional parameter can be disabled per neighbor, thus
   the sensitive information can't be disclosed to untrusted neighbors.
